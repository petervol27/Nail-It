Firebase ML Kit offers an on-device image labeling feature that can detect common objects and concepts in photos. It doesn’t require an internet connection for basic labeling, but if you want more advanced results, you might need to use Google Cloud Vision (which requires enabling billing).

How Firebase ML Kit Works for Image Labeling:
User uploads an image.
Firebase ML Kit analyzes the image locally on the device.
It returns labels like "nail", "finger", "hand", "manicure", "cosmetics", etc.
If the labels don’t match the allowed list, we reject the upload and show a warning.
If they do match, we proceed to upload the image to Firebase Storage.
Does it come included with Firebase?
Yes for the on-device image labeling (no billing needed).
No if you want Cloud Vision API — that requires Google Cloud with billing enabled.
🔧 Step-by-Step Firebase ML Kit Integration
1️⃣ Install Firebase ML Kit
bash
Copy
Edit
expo install @react-native-firebase/app @react-native-firebase/ml
2️⃣ Enable ML Kit in Firebase Console
Go to Firebase Console → Build → Machine Learning.
Enable the Image Labeling API.
3️⃣ Add Firebase Config (if not already done)
Ensure google-services.json for Android and GoogleService-Info.plist for iOS are correctly placed.
4️⃣ Code for Image Labeling
Here’s a simple function to analyze the image before uploading:

javascript
Copy
Edit
import ml from '@react-native-firebase/ml';

// 🔍 Image validation before upload
export const validateImage = async (imageUri) => {
  try {
    // ✅ Analyze the image
    const labels = await ml().cloudImageLabelerProcessImage(imageUri);
    
    // 🎯 Allowed keywords
    const allowedKeywords = ['nail', 'hand', 'finger', 'manicure', 'cosmetics'];
    
    // 🔍 Check labels
    const matches = labels.some(label => 
      allowedKeywords.some(keyword => label.text.toLowerCase().includes(keyword))
    );

    if (matches) {
      console.log('✅ Image accepted (Nail-related)');
      return true;
    } else {
      console.log('❌ Image rejected (Not related to nails)');
      return false;
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error during image labeling:', error);
    return false;
  }
};
5️⃣ Integrate with Upload Flow
Modify your upload logic like this:

javascript
Copy
Edit
const handleUpload = async () => {
  // 🖼️ Validate Image
  const isValid = await validateImage(imageUri);
  if (!isValid) {
    alert('Image does not appear to show nails. Please try again.');
    return;
  }

  // 📤 Proceed with upload
  const downloadUrl = await uploadImageToFirebase(imageUri);
  if (downloadUrl) {
    const designData = {
      title: designTitle,
      imageUrl: downloadUrl,
      creatorId: user.uid,
      private: uploadType === 'private',
    };
    await createDesign(designData);
    alert('Design uploaded successfully!');
    navigation.navigate(uploadType === 'private' ? 'MyProfile' : 'HomeMain');
  }
};
🧠 How It Works
ML Kit analyzes the image.
We look for labels related to nails (adjustable with your own keywords).
If the labels don’t match, we stop the upload.
If they do match, we upload the image as usual.
⚠️ Limitations
Accuracy: On-device models are simpler than cloud-based ones.
Performance: On-device models are fast but may misclassify uncommon nail designs.
Customization: For more control, consider training a custom model with Firebase AutoML.
